Androme(Android + Chrome)-Vision Project is aimed for letting us explore the possibilities of technology in the future, light the spark, and make it reality. Imagine your smartphone become as small as a credit card, while all surfaces-table, wall, window etc-can be utilized as touch screen. And more importantly, you can use them as intuitively as moving your fingers.
